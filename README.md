Event Log Manager
===============

C# .NET console application for managing Windows Event Logs.

Abstract
--------------

Having written a number of Windows applications, sites and services, I've found it desireable to have custom application logging, so your log messages don't get lost in generic Windows application logs.

The problem with logging to custom event logs and event log sources is that both need to be created in Windows, and there isn't a built-in tool for doing so.

This command line tool is designed to help facilitate the creation and management of these custom event logs.
